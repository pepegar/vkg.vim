vkg.vim
=======

vkg.vim is the vim plugin to control vkg directly from Vim. 

installation
------------
_vkg.vim_ depends on vkg. If you haven't vkg installed in your system yet, install it:
```
npm install -g coffee-script #just in case you have not installed it yet
npm install -g vkg
```

Temporal recomended installation method:
```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/pepegar/vkg.vim.git
```

vkg.vim is waiting for review at Vimawesome, but I expect to have it approved 
in the next days, so installing will be as easy as
```
vkg install vkg-vim
```
