vkg.vim
=======

vkg.vim is the vim plugin to control vkg directly from Vim. 

installation
------------
Temporal recomended installation method:
```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/pepegar/vkg.vim.git
```

vkg.vim is waiting for review at Vimawesome, but I expect to have it approved 
in the next days, so installing will be as easy as
```
vkg install vkg-vim
```
